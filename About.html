    Why did we create this website?

</p>
<div>
        <p class="poses2">
            This website was created as a result of our inspiration, 
            which can include a mix of personal interests, 
            professional objectives, a desire to make a contribution 
            to a particular subject, or a requirement to fill a void 
            in the online environment. Depending on the person and 
            their particular situation, the reasons can differ 
            drastically.

        <p class="poses2">
            It is essential to make sure that our website is accessible 
            to everyone. We are fostering an inclusive digital space that 
            serves people with a range of needs and disabilities by 
            making our website accessible. This accessibility enables 
            users of all abilities to access, explore, and interact with 
            the content on your website.

    Who are we?



</p>
<div>
        <p class="poses2">
            As teenage entrepreneurs we have a unique opportunity to
             make a positive impact on the world. Teaching meditation 
             poses and breathing techniques can be a great way to 
             promote well-being and help people improve their mental
              and physical health.

    Engineering design process 



</p>
<div>
        <p class="poses2">
            For the design process we first empathized and defined 
            what the actual problem was and we then brainstormed some 
            ideas in hopes of solving the issue at hand, and finally we 
            designed a prototype and coded it into our website.
