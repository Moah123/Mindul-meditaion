            1 - Seated Meditation Pose (Sukhasana): This is a basic and 
            versatile pose. Sit cross-legged on a cushion or a mat with
             your spine erect. You can use a meditation cushion (zafu) 
             or a folded blanket to support your hips and maintain a 
             comfortable seated position.

    2 - Half-Lotus Meditation Pose (Ardha Padmasana): In this pose, one 
    foot rests on the opposite thigh, while the other foot is tucked in 
    close to the body. This pose offers more stability than the 
    cross-legged position and is commonly used in traditional meditation
    practices.

    3 - Full Lotus Meditation Pose (Padmasana): This pose requires 
    flexibility and is considered one of the most stable positions 
    for meditation. Both feet are placed on the opposite thighs, with 
    the soles facing upward. It helps promote a grounded and centered 
    posture.

4 - Kneeling Meditation Pose (Seiza): Kneel on a cushion or meditation 
bench, keeping your knees slightly apart. Rest your buttocks on your 
heels, and keep your spine straight. This pose is an excellent 
alternative for those who find sitting cross-legged uncomfortable.

5 - Reclining Meditation Pose (Shavasana): Lie flat on your back, 
with your legs extended and your arms by your sides. This pose is often
 used for relaxation and body awareness meditations. It is particularly 
 suitable for individuals who have difficulty sitting for long periods.
